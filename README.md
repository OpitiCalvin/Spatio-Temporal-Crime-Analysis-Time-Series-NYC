# Spatio-Temporal-Crime-Analysis-Time-Series-for-New-York-City
This project gives an overview of crime time analysis in New York City . We have created Python Jupyter notebooks for spatial analysis of different crime types in the city using Pandas, Numpy, Plotly and Leaflet packages. As a second part to this analysis, we worked on ARIMA model on R for predicting the crime counts across various localities in the city based on correlations of various demographics correlation in each locality.
